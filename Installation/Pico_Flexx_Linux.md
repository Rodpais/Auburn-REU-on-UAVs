# Setting Up Pico Flexx in Linux
Configured in Ubuntu 18.04LTS on an x86-64bit processor with the Royale SDK 3.23.0.86 as of June 4th, 2019.

### Download and Unzip
Simply download the full SDK (not android) labeled "libroyale.zip" and unpack into your desired directory.
Unzip the next file, in this case "20190430_royale_3.23.0.86.zip"

### Unpack Correct File
Unzip the zipped folder that corresponds to your processor.
In this case, that is "libroyale-3.23.0.86-LINUX-x86-64Bit"

**Important** This must be unzipped into a path *without* spaces, i.e. /media/user/disk  .  Later in the install, the driver installer will have trouble navigating to a directory with spaces, i.e. /media/user/disk/this folder
