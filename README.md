# Auburn-REU-on-UAVs
Repository for the 2019 Auburn REU Team 1 to map an environment using 3D ToF on a quadcopter without GNSS

## Title of Project
> UAV SLAM and Interior Modeling with LiDAR in GNSS-Denied Environments

## Abstract
>   Small, quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicles (**UAV**s) have unique abilities to map environments, particularly utilizing 3D flash light detection and radar (**LiDAR**) technologies, which yield point cloud data sets. However, the majority of applications to date utilize global navigation satellite systems (**GNSS**) to determine location in order to stitch together LiDAR frames, which excludes mapping in environments without readily available or reliable GNSS (e.g. inside concrete buildings or underground.) In the context of search and rescue, providing an accurate and extensive 3D model through a UAV could provide emergency personnel critical information on the interior of the structure without risking human lives. Previous projects have been able to confirm the viability of autonomous flight through LiDAR and achieve simultaneous localization and mapping (**SLAM**) without GNSS. The project presented will equip a quadcopter UAV with a 3D LiDAR sensor and manually navigate through an interior environment to provide point cloud data to be processed into a thorough 3D model. This computer mock-up will be the amalgamation of the LiDAR and GNSS denied SLAM data gathered throughout the entire flight path and will provide a comprehensive, 3D representation of the interior.

> Conor Green is a Computer Engineering major at Loyola Marymount University, enrolled in the Honors College and pursuing a minor in Applied Mathematics. Every semester he has made Dean’s list and recently got invited and accepted into the engineering honor’s fraternity, Tau Beta Pi. Through the Honors department, Conor proposed, managed, and presented a $5000 research project on modifying the torque-slip characteristics of an induction motor through electro-plating that found significant results. Additionally, he was part of a team led by professor Dr. Huang to use computer vision to identify potholes from dash cam pictures in the Los Angeles area. Conor recently presented the induction motor and pothole research projects at This Is Honors and Undergraduate Research Symposium, respectively, at his university. He plans on pursuing graduate school in Electrical Engineering with the intention of earning a PhD.

> Conor has consistently worked various jobs since he turned sixteen, including multiple summers of full time work and private and volunteer tutoring (mainly mathematics.) He has worked at his university’s bike shop, the Cycling Lion, since its inception and is starting his second year as a manager. Outside of academics and work, Conor is the Vice-President of his university’s D2 rugby team and has participated in the UAV national competition SAE Aero West. He speaks Spanish fluently, through classes and learning through close friends, and studied abroad in Madrid, Spain, for a semester his sophomore year. For enjoyment, he reads fiction novels, particularly science fiction, and rides his longboard or skateboard.

> Brenden Stevens is majoring in Electrical Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles. Before transferring to UCLA from his community college in Visalia, CA, Brenden was the president in the leading science club involved with gathering speakers in STEM from around California to inspire young minds to continue pursuing science and engineering. He was also responsible for setting up weekly sports hang-outs where he and 20 others in the STEM department frequently played frisbee, basketball, and soccer. 

> In research, his past work involved testing and monitoring motor endurance and longevity for NASA’s X-57 all electric aircraft as well as signal latency calculations for CAN buses on the same aircraft. Brenden plans on pursuing graduate work in dynamics and controls with hopes of using machine learning and AI to aid his research.
