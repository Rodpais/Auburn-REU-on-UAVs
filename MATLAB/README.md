# MATLAB Scripts
The post-processing portion of the project will be done on MATLAB considering the propietary libraries for point clouds. The LiDAR and navigational data will be stored on a removable device on the drone and utilized on a personal computer later to create the comprehensive 3D model. Here is the current frame stitching progress.
